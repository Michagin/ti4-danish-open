      In ages past, the galaxy bowed to the regal rule of the
      Lazax, sovereigns whose dominion over the stars seemed eternal. Yet, complacency crept into
      their celestial court, and whispers of discontent echoed through the void. A rebellion, led by
      ambitious factions hungry for power, ensued, and the Lazax were ousted from their cosmic
      throne. Now, the once mighty empire lies in ruins, the throne vacant, waiting for a new ruler
      to ascend.
